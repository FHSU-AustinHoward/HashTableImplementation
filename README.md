## Project Description
In this project, students are required to implement a hash table class using the provided class and method structures 
to understand hash tables and the algorithms related to them. The main class, CSCI463ProjThree, is already implemented 
and should not be modified. This class will allow the user to input <ID, NAME> pairs, where both ID and NAME are 
strings with no whitespace.

The instructor has provided a rigid class and method structures that I must work within. I have defined these to match
the project requirements listed below.

The goal of this project is to help students understand hash tables and their associated algorithms by implementing and 
utilizing them within a structured framework.

## Lecturer's Notes
This project is designed to help students to understand the HashTable and algorithms related to HashTable. The students 
need to implement two given classes: MyHashEntry and MyHashTable.  

Three classes are given. The students shall not modify the CSCI463ProjThree.java file. However, the students should 
understand this file. The other two files, MyHashEntry.java and MyHashTable.java, are the files that the students need 
to finish.  

These two files, MyHashEntry.java and MyHashTable.java, must be implemented within the given design. The students 
cannot change the name of public methods. Please notice that the table must be implemented as a generic data structure.  

The students may run the given executable jar file to see how the project should work. When the students run the 
executable jar file, they may enter <ID, NAME> pairs. Please notice that ID or Name are all strings with no white space 
in it.
